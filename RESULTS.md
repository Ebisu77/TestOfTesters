#Here is a list of mistakes for this project. 

##Visual Mistakes:
- Form: Teachers name is not aligned
- Form: Header uses comic sans as a font
- Form: “Required fields are marked *” has a red asterisk, but in the text it is black
- Form: Check-box area has unnecessary outline
- Form: There are two horizontal lines under submit button
- Form: Horizontal line at the bottom is not aligned
- Contact: Header looks like hyperlink, but it is just a blue underlined text
- Layout: There is a football instead of copyright sign in the footer

##Coding Mistakes:
- Form: Age and Year of study can pass 0 value
- Form: Full name of teacher is clamped at 15 characters
- Form: First section is dragable without reason
- Form: Comprehensibility and Expertise have value 1 active
- Form: Attitude has disabled option 5
- Form: If the form is submitted without middle name, there will be “null” in the name in process form
- Form: Teacher name is not required
- Form: Date of Birth is working correctly only in some browsers (who is testing only in one will not find this error)
- Layout: Click on company logo throws routing error
- Index: Jumbotron background picture has 9,5 MB, performance issue

##Typing Errors:
- Form: YearOfStudy, PascalCase
- Form: Expertize instead of Expertise
- Form: TestFoorm in the URL, 2xO
- Form: Missing word in checkbox, sentence doesn’t make sense

- Form: Part=time in the type of study
- Form: Medicall in the Faculty dropdown (2xL)
- Form: Student information vs Teacher informations (incorrect plural)
- Form: School of design has “.” at the end

##Logical Mistakes: 
- Form: Header should be Teacher Evaluation Form, not Validation
- Form: There shouldn't be input for Age, form should make the calculation
- Form: This type of survey should be anonymous
- Form: At the bottom of the page it says “email address will not be published.“, but there is not an e-mail address field in the form
- Form: Checkbox asks if user wants feedback, but there is nowhere to send it to
- Form: Grading scale is not explained (is the best grade 5 or 1?)
- Form: Overall rating is missing a tooltip
- Form: Tooltips for Attitude and Expertise are switched
